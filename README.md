## Hola, this repository contains curated learning paths for various technologies

:bulb: Visit [paths.tinkerhub.org/python](https://paths.tinkerhub.org/python) for the python path.

### How to add a new learning path
You can create a learning path via one of the following methods.

#### 1. Using Netlify CMS
This is the easiest way of adding a new learning path. If you are familiar with GitHub and you consider youself as a CLI person, skip to the [Using Hugo CLI](#2-using-hugo-cli) section.

- Log in to the site's CMS at [paths.tinkerhub.org/admin](https://paths.tinkerhub.org/admin) using your github account
- To add a new learning path click on the **New Learning Path** button

#### 2. Using Hugo CLI
We will be using hugo, git and your favourite text editor to add the new learning path.

- Download and install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Fork the repository to your profile
- Clone the repository by running the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/{your-username}/TinkerHub-Learning-Paths.git
```
- Create a new branch by running the following command:
```bash
git checkout -b "learning-path-name"
```
- Run the following command to create a new learning path
```bash
 hugo new path-name.md
```
You can see that hugo generated a new file named `path-name.md` under the [content](./content) directory.

- Modify the file contents and metadata using your favourite text editor
- Run `hugo server` to preview your changes on the browser
- If you are good with your changes, commit, push and open a pull request to this repository

introTitle: TinkerHub Learning Paths
---
TinkerHub Foundation, the non-profit founded in 2014, is an organization working in alignment with the sustainable development goals of quality education, decent work, and economic growth.

Skill poverty has long-lasting repercussions in the Indian job environment where skill mismatch and underqualified graduates are the reasons for a massive unemployment rate. In a few years, unemployment is feared to become the cause of a greater economic disruption, with aftershocks that will have social, political, and economic dimensions.

TinkerHub Foundation was born out of our understanding of the above. Today, the community hosts, co-hosts, and partners with learning initiatives all over the country. For the next two years, our goal is to enable industry-relevant technology education to over 10,000 students across 300 colleges.

Learning Path is a virtual library with different paths or roadmaps listed, which a student can follow at any point in their journey of learning tech.

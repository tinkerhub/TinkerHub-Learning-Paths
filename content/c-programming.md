# Programming in C

C is a very powerful and widely used language.A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix.C is a general -purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions.It is used in many scientific programming situations. It forms (or is the basis for) the core of the modern languages Java and C++.

## Prerequisite

NOTHING. C is the basic language and the starting point to any programming language out there.

## Why prefer C?

It was (and still is in some circumstances) the language of choice in Operating System Development (including all of Unix).
It allows you direct control over the very low level aspects of the computer.
Many legacy programs are written in C.
Most of the things you learn with C will be directly transferable to future programming languages.
Programs that are created with C run very quickly.

## PREREQUISITES

The prerequisite for jumping into competitive programming is a good working knowledge of your favorite programming language, and some basic data structures. C++ is by far the most popular language of choice for competitive programmers due to its speed, and most resources/solutions will probably be written in C++.C++,java,python are the basic languages in competitive coding.

## HOW TO PREPARE

1. Choose a programming language
2. Understand the concept of time and complexity
3. Learn the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms
4. Take the challenge and coding problems
5. Practice and do it regularly

## What is Cybersecurity ?

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computers, networks and data from attacks damages or unauthorized access from malicious intent users. Cybersecurity is rather a package of strategies, technologies and best practices that would help in safeguarding information and infrastructure of an organization. Its an every evolving field in which attackers and defenders are getting better day by day 

## Prerequisites

Cybersecurity is one of those field which has the lowest entry barrier no matter you background you can easily grasp these contents if you have a passion for learning new things, To be stated some of those are 

1. Basic computer know-how
2. Networking Fundamentals such as TCP/IP protocol, OSI Model etc.
3. B﻿asic programming/scripting knowledge 
4. A﻿ mind to learn continuously, as cybersecurity is evolving day by day if you wont catch up with new things you would be left back 

## Topics To Learn

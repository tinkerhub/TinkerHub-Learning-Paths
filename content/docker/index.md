Docker is an open source containerization platform. It enables developers to package applications into containers which are standardized executable components combining application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment. Containers simplify delivery of distributed applications, and have become increasingly popular as organizations shift to cloud-native development and hybrid multi cloud environments.

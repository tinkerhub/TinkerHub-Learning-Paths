## Ways to make a game

1. Code a game from scratch using raw codding eg C++, JAVA, python etc...
2. Use a Game Engine

💡 Pro tip: please use a Game Engine if your goal is to make a game. don't re-invent the wheel

## Whats a Game Engine?

Game engines are tools available for game designers to code and plan out a game quickly and easily without building one from the ground up.

## Top Game Engines

1. [Unity](https://unity.com/)
2. [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/)
3. [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)
4. [GameMaker Studio](https://www.yoyogames.com/en/gamemaker) etc...

💡 My personal favourite is Unity, feel free to explore the others too..

Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google. It is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. Go was originally built for programs related to networking and infrastructure. It was intended to replace popular high-performance server-side languages like Java and C++. Today, Go is used for a variety of applications like cloud and server side applications, DevOps, command line tools and much more.



## PREREQUISITES

**Perfect for beginners.** you should have a basic understanding of computer programming terminologies. If you have a good command over C, then it would be quite easy for you to understand.

**A tool to edit your code.** Any text editor you have will work fine. Most text editors have good support for Go. The most popular are VSCode (free), GoLand (paid), and Vim (free).

**A command terminal.** Go works well using any terminal on Linux and Mac, and on PowerShell or cmd in Windows.

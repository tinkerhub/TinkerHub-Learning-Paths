Hacking is the activity of identifying weaknesses in a computer system or a network to exploit the security to gain access to personal data or business data. An example of computer hacking can be: using a password cracking algorithm to gain access to a computer system.

### Programming Knowledge

Programming knowledge is a must obviously.

## Learn Python,PHP,JS,HTML&CSS üöÄ

1. Basic knowledge about HTML,CSS&JS is must.
2. Learn any server side language like Python,PHP or Ruby.
3. If you want to code your own exploits, learn C.

üí° The python book [Learn python3: the hardway](https://www.amazon.in/Learn-Python-Hard-Way-Introduction/dp/0134692888) is a good resource.

## Install and setup stuffs üöß

Things you need and need not.

1. A üñ•Ô∏è running any linux based OS ‚úîÔ∏è (You can also use windows, but it sucks.)
2. A üß† to think ‚úîÔ∏è
3. Kali linux ‚ùó (even ubuntu will do the work)
4. Problem solving skills ‚úîÔ∏è
5. Investigation oriented mind ‚úîÔ∏è

#### üåù Only do this if you have plans to learn. First learn, then earn. There will be some time you may find yourself lost.

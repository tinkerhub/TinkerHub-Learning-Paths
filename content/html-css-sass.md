**HTML** stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. Hyper Text is text which contains links to other texts. It is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Markup tags are usually called HTML tags. HTML tags are keywords surrounded by angle brackets like `<html>`. Tags are in pairs like `<html>` and `</html>` called opening and closing tags. The opening tag and closing tag together specify a container for the content they enclose. The container and its contents together called an element. HTML provides all the facilities for web developers.

**CSS** stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used for describing the formatting and look of a document written in HTML. A style sheet is a syntactic mechanism for specifying style information. CSS is not technically HTML, but can be embedded in HTML documents. Since CSS style are written in common place, it separates CSS and HTML, which makes it easy for maintenance.

**SASS** stands for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets. It is a stylesheet language that is compiled to CSS and it is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language. It is an extension of CSS3, adding nested rules, variables, selector inheritance, and more. It is translated to well-formatted, standard CSS using the command line tool or a web-framework plugin. Using Sass to create style sheets makes the process quicker, less complicated and easier to maintain.

HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.

## Why learn HTML & CSS ‚ùì

HTML & CSS is the backbone of layout & designing of web pages. Whatever you _SEE_ in a web browser is basically HTML and CSS. Add some JavaScript with it and you'll have a pretty decent web app.

Here we will be focusing on the fundamental concepts of HTML & CSS without any frameworks. You might / might not be interested in creating a webpage layout in HTML & CSS from scratch depending on who you are. But it's always an advantage if you know some of the most important CSS concepts like Flexbox, Grid, Positioning, etc., especially when you are pursuing Front End Web development.

This path can't be considered as the full-fledged Front End Web Development path in any way. Layouting is just one part of the equation and you should learn some JavaScript ( And preferably a JS framework ). Now, before spending your time on javascript, You should be capable of understanding basic layout techniques in HTML and CSS. We'll leave the Front End Web Development path's link at the end of this path üòâ

## Flexbox üåü

Flexbox is a CSS3 web layout model (don't worry about it) that is extremely useful in achieving a lot of common layouts easily. It does have a small learning curve to it. But trust me, you are going to thank yourself later in your career for not skipping this part when you started learning web development.

## Positioning üåü

Although you might not have to use CSS positioning in your day-to-day web projects, this is a concept that is often overlooked by a lot of people who are starting. It is a really simple concept to understand when compared to Flexbox and Grids.

I will leave you with [this](https://github.com/bendc/frontend-guidelines) which talks about some guidelines and best practices to keep in mind when creating layouts with HTML and CSS and some more stuff that will be useful for you.

But as I mentioned at the beginning of this path, Layout is just a part of the equation. To be able to make a useful web app, you'll need to know a lot of javascript as well.

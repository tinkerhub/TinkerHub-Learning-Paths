Learning path for HTML & CSS curated by [Vighnesh](https://github.com/aka8921/)🎀

## Why learn HTML & CSS ❓

HTML & CSS is the backbone of layout & designing of web pages. Whatever you *SEE* in a web browser is basically HTML and CSS. Add some JavaScript with it and you'll have a pretty decent web app.

Here we will be focusing on the fundamental concepts of HTML & CSS without any frameworks. You might / might not be interested in creating a webpage layout in HTML & CSS from scratch depending on who you are. But it's always an advantage if you know some of the most important CSS concepts like Flexbox, Grid, Positioning, etc., especially when you are pursuing Front End Web development.

This path can't be considered as the full-fledged Front End Web Development path in any way. Layouting is just one part of the equation and you should learn some JavaScript ( And preferably a JS framework ). Now, before spending your time on javascript, You should be capable of understanding basic layout techniques in HTML and CSS. We'll leave the Front End Web Development path's link at the end of this path 😉

## Flexbox 🌟

Flexbox is a CSS3 web layout model (don't worry about it) that is extremely useful in achieving a lot of common layouts easily. It does have a small learning curve to it. But trust me, you are going to thank yourself later in your career for not skipping this part when you started learning web development.

Now, here are some of the best resources to learn Flexbox.

## Positioning 🌟

At this point, you have completed the basic concepts of HTML &  CSS. Congratulations on spending some of your days learning the basics of HTML and CSS. I will leave you with [this](https://github.com/bendc/frontend-guidelines) which talks about some guidelines and best practices to keep in mind when creating layouts with HTML and CSS and some more stuff that will be useful for you.

But as I mentioned at the beginning of this path, Layout is just a part of the equation. To be able to make a useful web app, you'll need to know a lot of javascript as well. Feel free to take a look at the [Front End Web Development](https://github.com/aka8921/TinkerHub-Learning-Paths/blob/main/learning/Frontend%20Web%20Development/Readme.md) path now that you have a good understanding of HTML and CSS.

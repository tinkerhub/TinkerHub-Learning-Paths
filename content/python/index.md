Learning path for learning python programming language ✨

## Install and setup stuffs 🚧

For learning python you need only two physical devices.

1. A computer running Linux, Windows or MacOS.
2. A working internet connection.

You need to install the following in your system.

### Python 3.\*

Python 2.7 is not maintained anymore as of 2020. Install python 3 or latest!

You can install from,

- [Python offical website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Anaconda python](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
- [Miniconda python](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

### Any simple good Code editor

No. Please don't code in notepad 🙄

💡 Choose a simple editor with intellisense and other features from a wide variety of editors.

Some examples

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [Sublime text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

## Learn how to use a terminal

2. How to invoke a python interpreter in terminal
3. How to [install packages using pip](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_pip.asp) or homebrew

## Learn basics of python

Learn basics like, `variables`, `conditions`, `loops`, `methods`..etc

💡 The book [automate the boring stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com) is a good resource.

🔮 [Articles](https://pythonprogramming.net/) and [Youtube Vidoes](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex) by [Sentdex](https://twitter.com/Sentdex) is awesome !

🎮 Learn python by coding a [simple game](https://opensource.com/article/20/12/learn-python)

### A wrap up of some basics

1. [Variables](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables.asp),[data types](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datatypes.asp) and [Precedence](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/precedence-associativity) of Operators
2. Data structures introduction - [List](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp), [Set](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets.asp), [Tuple](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp), [Dictionary](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp)
3. [String manipulation](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp)
4. [Math](https://www.w3schools.com/python/module_math.asp) and [Random module](https://www.w3schools.com/python/module_random.asp).

7. [Error Handling](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_try_except.asp)
8. [File Handling](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_file_handling.asp)
9. [Introduction to OOP with Python](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/object-oriented-programming)

## Write better python code

Learn how to write better python code

- [fluent python](https://www.amazon.in/Fluent-Python-Luciano-Ramalho/dp/1491946008) is a very good resource.
- [Hitchhiker's guide to python](https://docs.python-guide.org/)

## Learn to build web apps using python

Learn how to build web apps using python and a web app framework like,

- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) : Flask is a simple microframework with which you can build web apps.
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) : As it says web framework for perfectionists.
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) : High performance, easy to learn, fast to code, ready for production web app framework

All of the above frameworks have very good documentations and tutorials to learn.

## Do projects

There are 2 ways to do projects in python !

### Solve with python

1. Find a real world problem you are facing that can be automated using python.
2. There are tons of tons of packages in python to solve your issue.\
3. Google `package for <insert your problem domain> python` and see if one is available.
4. Use the package to build solution for your problem.

### Contribute to opensource projects

1. You can search github for good python projects.
2. Click issues of the github project you find interesting to contribute.
3. Go through the issues and find an issue you can code.
4. Write code for fixing that issue and put a pull request!

You can also [contribute while you learn python](https://github.com/donamath/PyLearn).

Happy learning :)

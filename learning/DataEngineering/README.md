# How to learn Data Engineering 🤔
The term Data Engineering is used loosley in different contexts. Here we’re trying to provide some guidance on the learning path and how you can start the journey towards big data engineering one step at a time.

# Why Learn Data Engineering ❓
Simple answer is - look around and all you see is nothing but data. 

- World is generating more and more data in every second in various forms and we need technology to harness and make sense of data.

- One other thing is, as you might be knowing, Data Science / Machine learning related areas are thriving in these days and the success of these projects largely depends on the quality of data being used and it is the responsibility of Data Engineers to provide the data in the required way and in the required format. 

- Apart from this, there is a lot of innovations and advancement happening in the data engineering technologies and we think it may be exciting for you to be part of it.

- On the lucrative side, data engineering/science is one among the most in demand jobs 😎   today and usually comes with a heavy paycheck 💰

# First things to learn 

First and foremost, all you need is a little bit of curiosity, interest and willingness to learn. Rest of the things needed will follow

A couple of points to be noted before we get into the thick of things 

👉  This learning path is intended for novice and aspiring engineers who wants to step into the Data engineering world and not for people with intermediate or advanced knowledge and skill looking for a mastery in Data engineering

👉  One of the challenges faced by newbies is the information overload and the sheer number of tools and technologies available in the Data Engineering world. People easily get overwhelmed by this and get confused on how and where to start. So, it is likely that you may not see a lot of latest and greatest tools and buzz words in data engineering here but that is intentional

Ok enough is enough, let’s get started  🧗🏼

When it comes to data engineering, essentially there are only two problems that you need to focus on as a beginner

1. **How you store your data:** A lot of organizations are embracing the idea of Data lake as their centralized repositories of structured and unstructed data. You can read a little bit of Data Lake concepts here [Data Lake](https://www.stitchdata.com/resources/what-is-data-lake/).
Try to get an understanding of various distributed storage options available like HDFS (mostly used as on-PREM storages) or S3, Google cloud storage etc. It is also important to understand the difference between various file formats used. Popular formats are orc, parquet and in some cases, data is stored as JSON or CSV as well. Read a little bit here[ Big Data File Formats](https://luminousmen.com/post/big-data-file-formats)

2. **How you process the data:** While it is again true that there is a ton of data processing tools and technologies available, but as a beginner, we would recommend getting some insights into the de facto data processing framework SPARK. In reality this is a swiss army knife for Data Engineers. Get an overview here [ SPARK](https://spark.apache.org/)

Now that we got an idea of *'WHAT'* needs to be learned for starters, let’s take a look at *'HOW'* to learn and where to start  

- Cognitive classes hosted by IBM is a good resource to start with. It is completely free and gives you some (limited) cloud-based Notebooks to learn and practice. Take a look at this

# Next Things to learn

- Another great resource is the Book  📚[ Hadoop Application Architecture](https://github.com/samadhankadam/Hadoop-Ebook/blob/master/Hadoop%20Application%20Architectures.pdf)
This is a bit older version, but the concepts and architecture basics are still relevant and pretty much well organised.

- For those who are impatient (like me 🤭 ), take a look at the  Table of Contents, this will at least give you an overview of the various life cycles of data engineering - How to model /store the data => then how to ingest the data  => Afterwards what are the processing options etc. etc. 

- Official spark documentation is pretty decent. Check it out here [Spark Documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/)

- A note on programming languages - Spark APIs are available in Scala, Python and in Java. 🔘 Choice is yours. 

- Code written in Scala is much more concise and less verbose. You don’t really need to be an expert in Scala to use Spark. Just enough Scala would be fine. Take a look here [ JUST ENOUGH SCALA](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/introduction-to-scala).

However, if you are already familiar with Python 🐍 or is inclined towards learning Data science then Python API would be a natural choice
 

### Free, unsolicited, out of context advice 🧐

One thing that I wish should have known earlier is the understanding of how to learn. Some of those things that we are following, or thinks is a good way of learning things may not be a very good and efficient way of learning. 

- An interesting google talk video here [Google Talks- Learning how to learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd2dtkMINIw)

- For serious learners check out this 📚 book [make it stick](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18770267-make-it-stick)

Happy learning 😀

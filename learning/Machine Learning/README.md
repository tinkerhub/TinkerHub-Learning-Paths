# How to learn ML for humans & :alien:

Learning path for AI/ML that worked for me :sparkles:

## Programming Knowledge 

Programming knowledge is a must obviously.

### Learn Python :snake:

1. Python basics : variables, conditions, loops..etc..etc..etc
2. But most importantly installing packages, importing, using.
3. Writing methods and using decorators.
4. Object oriented python: class, inheritance.

:bulb: The book [automate the boring stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com) is a good resource.


:crystal_ball: [Articles](https://pythonprogramming.net) and [Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex) by [Sentdex](https://twitter.com/Sentdex) is awesome!

### Install and setup stuffs :construction:

Things you need and need not.

1. A :computer: running any OS :white_check_mark:
2. A high end GPU :x:
3. Python installed [directly](https://www.python.org) or using [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com)/[miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#) :white_check_mark:
4. A heavy IDE like pycharm or spyder :interrobang:
5. Use light weight IDEs like [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com) :white_check_mark:


:bulb: Make sure you integrated installed python with your IDE and [intellisense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2019) works fine.

#### :full_moon_with_face: For god sake don't use notepad to code!

### Next steps with programming (recommended)
Do the following to take python learning to the next level
1. Build a python project and opensource.
2. Learn building a backend web app using [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)/[django](https://www.djangoproject.com)/[responder](https://responder.kennethreitz.org/en/latest/)

## ML algorithms and its Mathematics :1234:

### Truth about the maths
You need basic knowledge in the following mathematics areas for ML
1. Algebra
2. Probability
3. Differentiation

:bulb: Use your school/college text books to brush up maths skills.

### Learning algorithms
Use various resources in the internet to understand the concepts of following machine learning algorithms

1. Linear regression
2. Logistic regression.
3. Kmeans and KNN.
3. Neural networks.
4. Deep neural networks.

And the lists goes on...

:bulb: Check out this [awesome machine learning tutorials](https://github.com/ujjwalkarn/Machine-Learning-Tutorials) repo.

:crystal_ball: Checkout [d2l](http://d2l.ai/) for learning algorithm implementation

#### Pro tip : Learn the maths on the go. Means check out the maths part when you get stuck instead of going through maths first.

## Implementing the algorithms :woman_technologist:

This is an important part. Learning how to implement ML algorithms :boom:
- Try to implement the ML algorithms with vanilla python and the following libraries. 

### Packages to use
1. [Numpy](https://numpy.org) : For nuemerical computations
2. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) : For data preproessing 
3. [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) : For plotting the data 

## ML libraries and doing projects
Now you can learn an ML library and start doing projects in ML.

### Various ML libraries

1. [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html) : ML library with classic machine learning algorithms
2. [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials) & [keras](https://keras.io/getting_started/intro_to_keras_for_engineers/) : DL libary with keras as high level API
3. [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/) : DL library built built focusing for research.

and the list goes on...

:bulb: You can start with any of the libraries. I would recommend to use offical docs and tutorials to learn!

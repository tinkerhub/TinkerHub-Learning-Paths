# How to learn Python :snake:

Learning path for learning python programming language :sparkles:

## Install and setup stuffs :construction:

For learning python you need only two physical devices.

1. A computer running Linux, Windows or MacOS.
2. A working internet connection.

You need to install the following in your system.

Python 2.7 is not maintained anymore as of 2020. Install python 3 or latest!

You can install from,

- [Python offical website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
- [Anaconda python](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
- [Miniconda python](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

### Any simple good Code editor

No. Please don't code in notepad :roll_eyes:

:bulb: Choose a simple editor with intellisense and other features from a wide variety of editors.

Some examples

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [Sublime text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

## Write better python code

Learn how to write better python code 

- [fluent python](https://www.amazon.in/Fluent-Python-Luciano-Ramalho/dp/1491946008) is a very good resource.
- [Hitchhiker's guide to python](https://docs.python-guide.org/) 

## Learn to build web apps using python

Learn how to build web apps using python and a web app framework like,

- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) : Flask is a simple microframework with which you can build web apps.
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) : As it says web framework for perfectionists.
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) : High performance, easy to learn, fast to code, ready for production web app framework

All of the above frameworks have very good documentations and tutorials to learn.
